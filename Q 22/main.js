// Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one of your
//  programs yet, try to make one happen. Change an index in one of your programs to 
//  produce an index error.Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.
// CREATING ARRAY:
var errArray = ["A", "B", "C", "D"];
console.log(errArray[7]); //wrong array to call which is not exist.
// which result is undefined.
console.log(errArray[1]); //correct ARRAY to resolve.
// which result is B

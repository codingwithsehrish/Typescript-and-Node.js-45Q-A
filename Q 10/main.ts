// QUESTION 10:

// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each.
//  If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
// just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. 
// Then write one sentence describing what the program does.


let whitespace="\n sehrish khatri \n beenis khatri \n"
console.log(whitespace) // \n is used for new line and \t is used for whitespace.
let whitespace1="\n mehwish \n"
console.log(whitespace1) 

let withoutwhitespase=whitespace.trim()
console.log(withoutwhitespase);

// QUESTION 20
// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a
//  list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d 
// like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
///by own self concept:
//making an favorite countries ARRAY:
var favorite_visit_places = ["\n SAUDIA \n MADINAH \n Kashmir \n Turkey"];
//print the message of list
console.log("These  are my favourivte countries I wanted to visit");
//print the value of Array in the form of list:
favorite_visit_places.forEach(function (countries) {
    console.log(countries);
});
// or ANOTHER METHOD://it is more reliable: 
//making an favorite countries ARRAY:
var favorite_places = ["SAUDIA", "MADINAH", "Kashmir", "Turkey"];
//print the message of list
console.log("These  are my favourivte countries I wanted to visit");
//print the value of Array in the form of list:
favorite_places.forEach(function (countries) {
    console.log(countries);
});
